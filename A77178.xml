            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Had rather act than ſpeak in the weighty buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Kingdome which have been ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently handled by thoſe four Gentlemen that ſpake laſt, and therefore I ſhall be ſhort.</p>
            <p>When I do look upon the body of this goodly flouriſhing Kingdome in matter of Religion and of out Lawes, for like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins they live and die together, I ſay, when I behold both theſe in the ſtate and plight as they have been preſented unto us, <hi>Flere magis libet quàm dicere.</hi> But this is our comfort, Maſter Speaker, that we are here met together for the welfare and happineſſe of Prince and People, and who knowes whether this may not be the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time wherein God will reſtore our Religion as at the firſt, and our Lawes as at the beginning.</p>
            <p>The honour conſiſts in the weal of his people: this undoubted maxime his Majeſty hath made good by his late gracious Speech and Promiſe to us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe all our grievances, the enemies of peace and plenty.</p>
            <p>To make a People rich they muſt have Eaſe and Juſtice: eaſe in their conſciences from the bane of ſuperſtition, from the intolerable burthen of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Religion, and from the racks and tortures of ſtrange new fangled Oathes. They muſt be eaſed in their perſons, being <hi>liberi homines,</hi> and not villains, from all illegall arreſts and impriſonments againſt <hi>Magna charta,</hi> being our greateſt Libertie. They muſt be eaſed in their Lands from Forreſts, where never any Deer-fees; from depopulation, where

               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->
never any Farme was decayed; and from Incloſure, where never any hedges were ſet; They muſt be eaſed in their goods from exactions and exſpoliations of Purſuiants, and Apparitors, of Projectors and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoliſts, <hi>Humanarum calamitatum mercatores,</hi> as an antient Writer finely cals them: and if the firſt have all theſe eaſements, yet if they have not juſtice, they cannot ſubſiſt; Juſtice is to the civill body as food to the naturall: if the ſtreames of juſtice be by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe turned into Gall or Wormewood, or by cruelty like the Egyptian waters turned into blood, thoſe which drinke of theſe brooks muſt needs die and periſh. The Law ſaith that all Juſtice is in the King, who is ſtiled in our book, <hi>Fons justitie,</hi> and he commits it to the Judges for the execution, wherein he truſts them with two of the choiceſt flowers which belong to the Crowne, the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice, and the expoſition of Lawes, that he would not truſt them without an oath required of them by the ſtature of 18. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which is ſo ſtrickt and ſevere, that it made a judge whom I know, though honeſt and ſtout, to quake and tremble at the very mention of it.</p>
            <p>The effect of the oath is that they ſhall do equall Lawes and execution of rights to all the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as well poor as rich, without regard to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they ſhall not deny to do common right to any man, by the Kings letters, or for any other cauſe, and in caſe ſuch letters do come that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to do the Law notwithſtanding ſuch letters, as they will anſwer it to the King in their bodies, lands, and goods.</p>
